                <p>The Powerpuff Girls[b] is an American superhero animated television series created by animator Craig
                    McCracken and produced by Hanna-Barbera (later Cartoon Network Studios) for Cartoon Network. The
                    show centers on Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup, three kindergarten-aged girls with superpowers.
                    They live in the fictional city of Townsville with their father and creator, a scientist named
                    Professor Utonium, and are frequently called upon by the city's mayor to help fight nearby criminals
                    and other enemies using their powers.</p>
                <p>While attending his second year at CalArts in 1992, McCracken created a short film, Whoopass Stew!,
                    about a trio of child superheroes known as the Whoopass Girls, which was only shown at festivals.
                    Following the name change to The Powerpuff Girls, McCracken submitted his student film to Cartoon
                    Network, who aired the series' refined pilot, "Meat Fuzzy Lumpkins", in its animation showcase
                    program World Premiere Toons on February 20, 1995, along with its follow-up, "Crime 101", on January
                    28, 1996. Network executives gave McCracken the greenlight for a full series, which debuted as a
                    Cartoon Cartoon on November 18, 1998.</p>

                <p>The Powerpuff Girls aired on Cartoon Network for six seasons, three specials, and a feature film,
                    with the final episode airing on March 25, 2005. A total of 78 episodes were produced, in addition
                    to the two pilots, a Christmas special, the film, a tenth anniversary special, and a special episode
                    in computer animation. Various spin-off media include an anime, three CD soundtracks, a home video
                    collection, comic books, a series of video games, a 2016 reboot series, and an upcoming reboot
                    series, as well as various licensed merchandise. The series has been nominated for six Emmy Awards,
                    nine Annie Awards, and a Kids' Choice Award during its run.</p>

                <p>Teen Titans is an American animated superhero television series created by Glen Murakami and
                    developed by Murakami, David Slack and Sam Register. Based on DC Comics's superhero team Teen
                    Titans, it was produced by Warner Bros. Animation, and DC Comics (for season 5). The show premiered
                    on Cartoon Network on July 19, 2003; its first two seasons also aired on Kids' WB. Initially, only
                    four seasons were planned, but the popularity of the series led to Cartoon Network ordering a fifth
                    season. The final half-hour episode of the show, "Things Change", aired on January 16, 2006; it was
                    later followed by a TV movie, Teen Titans: Trouble in Tokyo, that premiered on September 15 the same
                    year, serving as the series finale. A 15-minute episode titled "The Lost Episode" was released as
                    part of an online promotional campaign by Post Consumer Brands in January 2005.</p>
                <p>Teen Titans became one of Cartoon Network's most popular series, renowned for its humor, storylines,
                    and banter between the main characters. During its run, the series was nominated for three Annie
                    Awards and one Motion Picture Sound Editors Award. Spin-off media included comics, DVD releases,
                    video games, music albums, and collectible toys. In 2013, the show spawned a spin-off, titled Teen
                    Titans Go!, which received a theatrical film that was released on July 27, 2018, titled Teen Titans
                    Go! To the Movies. In 2019, a crossover film with Teen Titans Go! was released, titled Teen Titans
                    Go! vs. Teen Titans. It features the first appearance of the original series characters after 13
                    years.</p>
                <p>The series was first shown on Boomerang from February 2, 2009, replacing the Super Friends until
                    October 31, 2010. It returned to Boomerang's line-up on October 3, 2011, and left the schedule again
                    on June 1, 2014.</p>

                <p>The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy[b] is an American animated television series created by Maxwell
                    Atoms for Cartoon Network. It follows Billy, a dimwitted, happy-go-lucky boy, and Mandy, a cynical,
                    remorseless girl, who, after winning a limbo game to save Billy's pet hamster, gains Grim, the
                    mighty Grim Reaper, as their "best friend forever". Grim, who is reluctant to serve the two
                    children, has access to supernatural items, spells, and other abilities that often lead Billy and
                    Mandy to interact with otherworldly environments, characters, or situations.</p>
                <p>Billy & Mandy began as a segment on Grim & Evil, from which it was a spin-off, along with sister
                    series Evil Con Carne, on August 24, 2001. Although the 2003–2004 episodes were produced for Grim &
                    Evil, the series aired (as a separate series) from June 13, 2003, to October 12, 2008, on Cartoon
                    Network. In 2007, the series produced two made-for-TV movies, respectively titled Billy & Mandy's
                    Big Boogey Adventure and Billy & Mandy: Wrath of the Spider Queen. A crossover special with fellow
                    Cartoon Network series Codename: Kids Next Door, entitled "The Grim Adventures of the KND", aired on
                    November 11, 2007. The series finale, a made-for-TV movie titled Underfist: Halloween Bash (intended
                    to serve as a pilot for a new spin-off series), aired on October 12, 2008.</p>
                <p>During its run, the series won two Emmy Awards and one Annie Award, with nominations for one Daytime
                    Emmy Award, three Golden Reel Awards, and two other Annie Awards. Billy & Mandy has also been made
                    into a video game as well as various licensed merchandise.</p>

                <p>Ben 10 (retroactively known as Classic Ben 10) is an American animated series created by Man of
                    Action, produced by Cartoon Network Studios and distributed by Warner Bros. Domestic Television. The

                    "Omnitrix". Attached to his wrist, it allows him to transform into 10 different alien creatures with
                    different abilities, allowing him to fight evil from Earth and space with his cousin Gwen and
                    grandfather Max. The series first aired on Cartoon Network as a sneak peek on December 27, 2005, as
                    part of "Sneak Peek Week", airing alongside other shows, including My Gym Partner's a Monkey,

                </p>
                <p>The series gradually became popular and was nominated for two Emmy Awards, winning one for
                    "Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation". The show spawned a franchise: three continuations
                    were released respectively as Ben 10: Alien Force, Ben 10: Ultimate Alien and Ben 10: Omniverse; as
                    well as a reboot of the series in 2016</p>
                <p>The series centers around Ben Tennyson (Tara Strong), a ten-year-old boy on a cross-country summer
                    vacation, with his cousin Gwen (Meagan Smith) and their grandfather Max (Paul Eiding). On their
                    first night camping in their grandfather's RV affectionately named the "Rustbucket," Ben finds an
                    alien pod with a mysterious watch-style device named the Omnitrix. The device then permanently
                    attaches itself to his wrist giving him the ability to transform into a variety of alien life-forms
                    each with its own unique skills and powers. With his newfound superpowers Ben has to learn the
                    responsibilities of being a hero. During their vacation, the Tennysons are attacked by various
                    enemies ranging from space aliens to supernatural entities.</p>

                    (best known as a member of the hip hop duo Outkast) and Thomas W. Lynch for Cartoon Network.
                    Produced by Tom Lynch Company and Moxie Turtle for Cartoon Network Studios, the series follows
                    superstar and music teacher Sunny Bridges (voiced by André), who teaches a group of students at
                    Atlanta, Georgia's Westley School of Performing Arts.[2] Bridges is a jazz and blues artist who
                    occasionally lectures in Atlanta's Little Five Points residential area. (Referencing Atlanta, both
                    OutKast and Cartoon Network are based in Atlanta.) Twenty-eight episodes were produced.[3] The show
                    debuted shortly after the hip-hop duo's breakup.</p>
                <p>Class of 3000 is the final Cartoon Network original series to premiere when Jim Samples was Cartoon
                    Network's General Manager and Executive Vice President, as he later resigned following the 2007
                    Boston Mooninite panic. The series has never reran.</p>
                <p>While on a trip to Turner Broadcasting in Atlanta to pitch projects, Thomas Lynch met with vice
                    president of programming for Cartoon Network Mike Lazzo, an old friend of his.[4] Lynch told him he
                    wanted to make an animated series with music, and Lazzo said he had a pilot.</p>

                <p>Adventure Time[c] is an American fantasy animated television series created by Pendleton Ward and
                    co-produced by Frederator Studios for Cartoon Network. The series follows the adventures of a boy
                    named Finn (Jeremy Shada) and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (John DiMaggio)—a dog with
                    the power to change size and shape at will. Finn and Jake live in the post-apocalyptic Land of Ooo,
                    where they interact with Princess Bubblegum (Hynden Walch), the Ice King (Tom Kenny), Marceline
                    (Olivia Olson), BMO (Niki Yang), and others. The series is based on a 2007 short film that aired on
                    Nicktoons. After the short became a viral hit on the Internet, Nickelodeon's executives passed on
                    its option before Cartoon Network commissioned a full-length series from Fred Seibert and Ward,
                    which was previewed on March 11, 2010. The same year, the series premiered on Cartoon Network on
                    April 5, and it ended its eight-year run on September 3, 2018.</p>
                <p>The series drew inspiration from a variety of sources, including the fantasy role-playing game
                    Dungeons & Dragons and video games. It was produced using hand-drawn animation; action and dialogue
                    for episodes are decided by storyboarding artists based on rough outlines. Because each episode took
                    roughly eight to nine months to complete, multiple episodes were worked on concurrently. The cast
                    members recorded their lines in group recordings, and the series regularly employed guest actors for
                    minor and recurring characters. Each episode runs for about eleven minutes; pairs of episodes are
                    often telecast to fill half-hour program slots. Cartoon Network announced on September 29, 2016,
                    that the series would conclude in 2018, after the airing of its tenth season. The series finale
                    aired on September 3, 2018, which was followed by the Adventure Time: Distant Lands specials and the
                    Adventure Time: Fionna and Cake spin-off, which were released on Max.[d] Two additional spin-offs,
                    entitled Adventure Time: Side Quests and Adventure Time: Heyo BMO, have also been greenlit by
                    Cartoon Network Studios as of June 2024.</p>

                <p>Steven Universe is an American animated television series created by Rebecca Sugar for Cartoon
                    Network. It tells the coming-of-age story of a young boy, Steven Universe (Zach Callison), who lives
                    with the Crystal Gems—magical, mineral-based aliens named Garnet (Estelle), Amethyst (Michaela
                    Dietz), and Pearl (Deedee Magno Hall)—in the fictional town of Beach City. Steven, who is half-Gem,
                    has adventures with his friends and helps the Gems protect the world from their own kind. The pilot
                    was first shown in May 2013, and the series ran for five seasons, from November 2013 to January
                    2019. The TV film Steven Universe: The Movie was released in September 2019, and an epilogue limited
                    series, Steven Universe Future, ran from December 2019 to March 2020.</p>
                <p>The themes of the series include love, family, and the importance of healthy interpersonal
                    relationships. Sugar based the lead character on her younger brother Steven, who was an artist for
                    the series. She developed Steven Universe while she was a writer and storyboard artist on Adventure
                    Time, which she left when Cartoon Network commissioned her series for full production. The series is
                    storyboard-driven; the show's storyboard artists were responsible for writing the dialogue and
                    creating the action in addition to drawing the storyboards.</p>

                <p>Phineas and Ferb is an American animated musical-comedy television series created by Dan Povenmire
                    and Jeff "Swampy" Marsh for Disney Channel and Disney XD. The series originally aired on the
                    networks for four seasons between 2007 and 2015 and is scheduled to return for two additional
                    seasons beginning in 2025. The series follows stepbrothers Phineas Flynn and Ferb Fletcher during
                    summer vacation. Every day, the boys construct a grand project or embark on a spectacular adventure
                    to make the most of their time on vacation. This annoys their controlling older sister, Candace, who
                    frequently tries to expose their schemes to her and Phineas's mother. The series follows a standard
                    plot system; running gags occur every episode.</p>
                <p>Povenmire and Marsh conceived the characters while working together on animated programs The Simpsons
                    and Rocko's Modern Life in the 1990s, and were inspired by the summers of their own childhoods. They
                    developed the series together and pitched it to networks for 16 years before successfully selling it
                    to The Walt Disney Company. Phineas and Ferb is produced by Disney Television Animation, and was
                    originally broadcast as a one-episode preview on August 17, 2007, following the premiere of the
                    made-for-television film High School Musical 2. It again previewed on September 28, 2007, and
                    officially premiered on Disney Channel on February 1, 2008. The series originally concluded on June
                    12, 2015, before two new seasons were ordered in January 2023, the first of which is scheduled to
                    premiere on Disney Channel and the streaming service Disney+ in 2025</p>
                <p>Phineas and Ferb is one of Disney Channel's most successful animated franchises. It received high
                    viewership in the United States on cable television and influenced the development of merchandise, a
                    live tour, spin-offs, and movies. A made-for-television film, Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the
                    2nd Dimension, aired in 2011, while a follow-up titled Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Candace Against
                    the Universe was released on Disney+ in 2020. Critics praised the writing and humor of the show,
                    citing its appeal to a wide range of ages. Others criticized its lack of originality and formulaic
                    approach. The series won a Daytime Emmy Award in 2010 for Outstanding Writing in Animation and
                    several Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation.</p>

                <p>Crayon Shin-chan (Japanese: クレヨンしんちゃん, Hepburn: Kureyon Shin-chan) is a Japanese manga series
                    written and illustrated by Yoshito Usui. Crayon Shin-chan made its first appearance in 1990 in a
                    Japanese weekly magazine called Weekly Manga Action, which was published by Futabasha. Due to
                    the death of author Yoshito Usui, the manga in its original form ended on September 11, 2009. A
                    new manga began in the summer of 2010 by members of Usui's team,[6] titled New Crayon Shin-chan
                    (新クレヨンしんちゃん, Shin Kureyon Shin-chan).</p>
                <p>An animated television adaptation began airing on TV Asahi in 1992 and is still ongoing, with
                    over 1000 episodes. The show has been dubbed in 30 languages which aired in 45 countries.[7] As
                    of 2023, both the Crayon Shin-Chan and New Crayon Shin-Chan series has over 148 million copies
                    in circulation, making it among the best-selling manga series in history.</p>
                <p>Set in the city of Kasukabe of Saitama Prefecture within the Greater Tokyo Area of Japan, the
                    series follows the adventures of the five-year-old Shinnosuke "Shin" Nohara and his parents,
                    baby sister, dog, neighbours, and best friends. Most of the plot is about Shin-chan's daily
                    life, but it is also often interspersed with a lot of fantastic and incredible elements.</p>
                <p>Many of the jokes in the series stem from Shin-chan's occasionally weird, unnatural and
                    inappropriate use of language, as well as from his mischievous behaviour. Consequently,
                    non-Japanese readers and some viewers may find it difficult to understand his jokes. Some gags
                    may require an understanding of Japanese culture and/or language to be fully appreciated; for
                    example, his "Mr. Elephant" impression, while being transparently obvious as a physical gag,
                    also has a deeper resonance with contemporary Japanese culture since it refers to the popular
                    Japanese children's song "Zou-san" (ぞうさん). But after modest translation, it is popular in the
                    rest of Asia due to cultural compatibility. It also contains many sarcastic jokes and stereotype
                    humor</p>
